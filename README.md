# This is the source code for Weda (Beijing) Official Website

#### The source code for ReactJS front-end can be found in the repo named weda_bj_offical 

The ReactJS front-end consists of about 50 components that serve to show the products, videos and latest news at Weda. 


#### The server side is located in file /server

The server is implemented by ExpressJS. The web app has a comment session where users can leave a message. I built internal tools using NodeJS to enable the administrator myself to receive comments via my personal email. 

#### The project is deloyed on Alibaba Cloud

Note that it is possible to encounter delays when trying to access the web app from outside of China.
